# hanabira.org

https://hanabira.org - free Japanese learning open source website portal.

Unlike other language learning portals, this project is fully open sourced, including its full content - with vocabulary, example sentences, grammar explanations, short stories and SRS flashcards.

Currently hanabira provides content mainly for Japanese language, but eventually we will be adding Korean, Vietnamese and Thai.
