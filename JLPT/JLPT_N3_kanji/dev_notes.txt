Here I'm picking JLPT N3 level Kanji that have only one reading needed for this level. This doesn't mean that Kanjis do not have other reading that is more rare. But for JLPT N3 are these readings sufficient.

Nihongo So Matome JLPT N3 Kanji book.

--------------------------------------------

Write example japanese sentence containing following word
皿
add romaji and english translation

Explain origin of following japanese kanji:
皿

Explain meaning of following japanese kanji:
皿

Add additional information about following japanese kanji:
皿

Add example japanese words containing this kanji.

Write the output in JSON format, include the original word.
Example words and sentence should be on JLPT N3 level.

Write the JSON output in following format. 
This is just an example so we have structure of the JSON payload.
{
    "kanji": "満",
    "kanji_simplified": "マン",
    "kanji_romaji": "man",
    "kanji_meaning": "full, satisfied, sufficient",
    "sentence_japanese": "彼は食べ物が満足しています。",
    "sentence_romaji": "Kare wa tabemono ga manzoku shite imasu.",
    "sentence_translation": "He is satisfied with the food.",
    "kanji_origin": "describe origin of given kanji",
    "kanji_meaning": "describe meaning given kanji",
    "kanji_info": "describe additional information about given kanji",
    "compound_words": [
    { "word": "満足", "romaji": "manzoku", "tranlation": "satisfaction" },
    { "word": "満月", "romaji": "mangetsu", "translation": "full moon" },
    { "word": "満員", "romaji": "manin", "translation": "full capacity" }
    ],
    "kanji_examples": [
    { "expression": "満足感", "romaji": "manzokukan", "translation": "a feeling of contentment" },
    { "expression": "満たされない", "romaji": "mitasarenai", "translation": "not fulfilled, not content" },
    { "expression": "満ち足りた", "romaji": "michita tarita", "translation": "having had enough, content" }
    ]
}

manually, we can then inject the primary_vocab_jap, primary_vocab_simpl, primary_vocab_trans  
信用（しんよう）　    | trust|
add as
"primary_vocab": {"word":"信用","simplified":"（しんよう）","translation":"trust"}
this primary vocab comes from sou matome and is surely on JLPT N3 level, so we should have it there

when we put the specific reading in the GPT prompt, GPT gets confused and starts to force the reading to wrong places
it is because "JLPT N3 kanji with one reading" can have multiple readings on higher levels
we might need to inject the correct reading as primary JLPT N3 reading
plus of course we will need to inject some other metadata, like JLPT level and coder 25 for example



the GPT generated examples can be toggled on/off in the frontend

Use together with browser plugin called Yomichan so you get the audio pronounciation as well.

| Kanji | example word | translation
| :---------   | :--------------     | :----------- |
| 駐（チュウ）  | 駐車（ちゅうしゃ）    | parking |
| 満（マン）　  | 満車（まんしゃ）    　| full of cars|
