KoNLPy is python package that allows us to process Korean language

we can use it for Tokenization

in general, this should unify multiple korean NLP tools, so should be very advanced

Yes, there are several alternatives for Korean language analysis similar to MeCab. One popular choice is called KoNLPy, which is a Python package that provides a simple interface to many Korean NLP tools, including KoNLP (Hannanum, Kkma), Komoran, Mecab (with optional plugin), and Twitter. You can use it to tokenize Korean text, extract morphemes, and perform various other NLP tasks. KoNLPy allows you to choose the backend tool according to your preference or performance requirements. Give it a try if you're looking for a Korean language parser!

my tests - we need to say that we are using KoNLPy (I suppose we could also mention Mecab as wellfor transparency)

explain this output, I do not speak korean, explain the words as well

Original sentence: 한국어 문장을 형태소 분석하여 원형을 추출합니다.
[('한국어', '한국어'),

Sure, let's break down the output:

Original sentence: 한국어 문장을 형태소 분석하여 원형을 추출합니다. (Translation: "Analyzing Korean sentences to extract the base form.")
The output shows each word in the original sentence paired with its dictionary form (base form). Here's the breakdown:
'한국어' (han-gu-geo): It means "Korean language." In this case, the dictionary form is the same as the original word.
'문장' (mun-jang): It means "sentence." Again, the dictionary form is the same as the original word.
'형태소' (hyeong-tae-so): It means "morpheme" or "word element." The dictionary form is the same as the original word.
'분석' (bun-seok): It means "analysis." The dictionary form is the same as the original word.
'원형' (won-hyeong): It means "base form" or "root form." The dictionary form is the same as the original word.
'추출' (chu-chul): It means "extraction" or "extraction process." The dictionary form is the same as the original word.
In summary, the program tokenized the sentence into words and returned each word paired with its dictionary form. Since the original words are already in their dictionary form, the output shows the same word for both the original and dictionary forms.
