grammar point generation from file called
N3_grammar_week6.md

we will call GPT4 API with script called
python3 app_grammar_jap_kword.py "Aその上 B"




but bulk requests will be processed with wrapper shell script called
grammar_wrapper.sh

# ./grammar_wrapper.sh N3_grammar_week6.md grammar_output1.txt



best to write script that will sort all the grammar from all files alphabetically
maybe sort will suffice, should work fine
we do not want to have the same grammar order as sou matome
