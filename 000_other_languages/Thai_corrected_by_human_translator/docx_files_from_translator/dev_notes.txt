the romaji is not fixed, translator just marked it with ***
next to the sentence
so I need to manually regenerate lots of thai romaji, best would be to learn
thai alphabet as well, because it is lots of things to fix manually
and i cannot rely on GPT obviously for that


yeah, i definitely need to learn their alphabet, there is no other way
I have to learn it very well, GPT is not good at romanization at all
