You are teacher that teaches Chinese to students. What is the most popular internationally recognised Chinese language proficiency exam?
ChatGPT
The most popular internationally recognized Chinese language proficiency exam is the Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì (HSK), which translates to the "Chinese Proficiency Test." Administered by the Hanban (Confucius Institute Headquarters), the HSK tests non-native speakers on their abilities in Mandarin Chinese, both in written and spoken forms.

The HSK has multiple levels:

HSK Level 1: For beginners who can understand and use some simple Chinese characters and sentences to communicate.
HSK Level 2: For elementary learners who can use Chinese in a simple and direct manner, suitable for daily needs.
HSK Level 3: For intermediate learners who can use Chinese to serve the demands of their personal lives, studies, and work.
HSK Level 4: For intermediate Chinese learners who can discuss a wide range of topics in Chinese and are capable of studying in a Chinese-taught undergraduate program.
HSK Level 5: For learners who can read Chinese newspapers and magazines, watch Chinese films, and deliver a full speech in Chinese.
HSK Level 6: For learners who can easily comprehend written and spoken information in Chinese and can express themselves fluently in Chinese both spoken and written.
In addition to the written tests, there are also HSK Speaking Tests, which are divided into HSK (Beginner), HSK (Intermediate), and HSK (Advanced).

Students and professionals aiming to study or work in China, or who need to demonstrate Chinese proficiency for other reasons, often take the HSK exam.
